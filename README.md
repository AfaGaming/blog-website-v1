# blog-website-v1
This is a simple blog website built using HTML, CSS, Java Script, Node.js, Express but most importantly, putting into practice what I learnt about EJS. 

Note: This website **does not use a database** so all posts you make will be removed if the server restarts or the website is re-deployed.
